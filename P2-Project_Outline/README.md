## Submission Instructions

1) Overview
	My bills app is going to be a web application that tracks your monthly bills.  This idea came to me because I get stressed every month when it comes to my bills.  I can never keep track of which bills are due when.  I also share some bills with my roommate so I would like an app that can also track the shared bills and let me know how much I owe and how much my roommate owes as well.  This app will allow users to keep track of all their monthly bills and indicate if the bill is a personal or shared bill.  The app will then calculate how much the user owes and how much the roommates owe the users.  Then, hopefully the app will also be able to send an email to the roommates to let them know how much they owe for the month.

2) Features

	--User creation/login : Users will create a login where they will indicate how many 		roommates they have and will also input their roommates emails.  Each user will have a main page that lists all their monthly bills (both shared and personal).

	--Add bills :  This feature will allow the user to add monthly bills.  To add a bill you will need to include the type of bill, the company name, the company website, and if it is personal or shared.

	--This month’s bills: This feature will be the main user log in page.  On this page you will see a list of the monthly bills and next to each bill will be an input box where you input that month’s cost.  Once all the bills are inputted you can submit to create a record of that month’s bills.

	--this month’s bill record: This feature will allow the user to see their personal cost of all this month’s bills.  It will also show them a record of the cost of all the shared bills.  There will be a send email button from this screen.  This button will allow the user to send an automated email to their roommates letting them know how much they owe that month. 

	--past bills records: this feature will allow users to review all their past bills.  They can search by date, bill type, company, or keyword.

4) What you’ll have to learn
	
	I’m going to have to learn how to create a table in a database (to house the monthly bills) and then how to create a table based on that table (to create the this month’s bills record).  I will have to learn how to send automated emails.  I will also learn how to connect a user to their records they have created.
